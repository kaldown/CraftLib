CraftLib is a standalone library addon providing a complete crafting recipe database for World of Warcraft addon developers.

> **This is a developer library** - It has no UI on its own. Other addons (like [LazyProf](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/lazyprof)) use CraftLib for recipe data.

## What's Included

- **Complete recipe data** - Skill levels, reagents, difficulty thresholds
- **Source information** - Where every recipe comes from (trainers, vendors, quests, drops, reputation)
- **Clean API** - Simple query functions for easy integration
- **Fast lookups** - Query by spell ID or crafted item ID

## Profession Coverage

| Profession | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Cooking | Complete |
| First Aid | Complete |
| Alchemy | In Progress |
| Blacksmithing | In Progress |
| Enchanting | In Progress |
| Engineering | In Progress |
| Jewelcrafting | In Progress |
| Leatherworking | In Progress |
| Tailoring | In Progress |
