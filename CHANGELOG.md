## [Unreleased]

### Added

- STARTER source type for auto-learned recipes (e.g., Herb Baked Egg)
- Training cost data for trainer-learned recipes
- DISCOVERY and WORLD_DROP source types reserved for future use

### Changed

- Pipeline rewrite: single-pass Wowhead fetch replaces three separate modes
- All 1,925 recipes now have Wowhead-verified source classifications
- Source reclassifications: ~200 recipes corrected from VENDOR/DROP to TRAINER where trainable in TBC
- Scripts fail loudly on missing data instead of silently defaulting to zero

### Removed

- 6 additional removed/unverifiable recipes (51 total filtered from DB2)

## [0.2.12] - 2026-01-30

  - Thorium Shells: yellow 305->295, green 315->300, gray 325->305
- Enchanting "conversion" recipes (Large Prismatic Shard, Small Prismatic Shard, Void Shatter) now require correct skill level (335/375)
- Fixed orange=0, yellow=0 recipes using gray as skillRequired (prevents conversion recipes appearing at skill 1)

### Fixed

- Early-game recipes (yellow ≤ 75) now correctly use skillRequired=1

## [0.2.6] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed

- Fixed Wowhead fetch script parsing bug that captured wrong difficulty data
- Script now looks for spell-specific data instead of first match on page
- Re-fetched corrupted recipes: Fel Iron Bomb, Adamantite Grenade, Cooking TBC recipes, Netherweave Bandages
- Added --spells flag to allow re-fetching specific recipes even if already verified

## [0.2.5] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed

- Specialty recipes with orange=0 (e.g., Dimensional Ripper - Area 52) now use the correct skillRequired value
